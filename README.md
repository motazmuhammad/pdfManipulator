# pdfManipulator

## Aims

The aim of this project is to create an intuitive pdf manipulator for the people. That is both fast and lightweight. Something like Mac's preview ultimately
I have looked at a couple of the existening open source solutions and they were either insatisfactory or too much.

I have decided to use QT for this project. I have not decided yet if I will use QT create ( the most obvious choice) or visual studio Community, not Decided yet.

I want this project to be as cross platform as possible. While I will start with windows. I will definitely compile it for linux and Mac as well. In time I may go for mobile as well.

vcpkg will be used for package management so that developers are not burdened with big weight code.

For now, that is it.
